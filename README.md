# California and United States Emissions and Energy Production

## Project Intro

Never on human history have seen all the changes happening on our Planet so fast. The answer of this changes is call climate change. A statement release by the Secretary of Defense
said that "It is a national security issue, and we must treat it as such." (Austin III).
To understand how climate change, we need to know what contributes to it and how can we start taking action to compensate our mistakes. According to NASA, Human activities (primarily the burning of fossil fuels) have fundamentally increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in Earthâ€™s atmosphere, warming the planet.
The main gases that contributes to climate change are "Water vapor, Carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane, Nitrous oxide and Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)."("The Causes Of Climate Change")

So we asked ourselves, how is United States and California contributing to the emissions, specificly CO2, on the Energy Production and how is it changing to reach net zero emissions by 2050 as it is "the internationally agreed upon goal for mitigating global warming."("What Is Net Zero? - Net Zero Climate")

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize all the data collected to represent the Renewable Energy in CA, Energy Production of US and CA and CO2 Emissions from CA and US from at least the last 10 years.

* Alternative Hypothesis: California has reduced CO2 emissions significaly and implemented a significally ammount of renewable energy sources.
* Null Hypothesis: California has not reduced CO2 emissions significaly and has not implemented a significally ammount of renewable energy sources.
